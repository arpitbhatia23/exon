# Contributing

Thanks for considering contributing to Exon. Guidelines:

- Clone the repo and open a branch for your work.
- Run and test CLI changes locally using `node ./dist/bin/exon.js` after building, or run TS in dev flows.
- Keep changes focused and open a PR with a clear description.

If adding templates, ensure:

- Template folders are complete and include `deps.json` and `env.append` when necessary.
- Any runtime scripts referenced in `package.json` work across platforms (Windows/macOS/Linux).
